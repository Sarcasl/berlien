<!-- 
    For each animal I started with a heading tag (h2) for each animal name. 
    I placed an image (img) of each animal below the heading. 
    Next line was a paragraph tag (p) for the description and another heading tag that's a smaller size (h3). 
    I used a unordered list tag (ul) to list the names of each animal.
    Below the list I put a hyperlink tag <a href> into a heading tag (h3) to link to an external website with more information on each animal.
